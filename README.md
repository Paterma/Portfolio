# Portfolio

## My Assignment

To create a portfolio of work that can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. Effective portfolios highlight your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 


## User Story

AS AN employee
I WANT a potential employer to view my deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT they can review samples of my work and assess whether I'm a good candidate for an open position.


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


## The Work

For this project I have created a portofilio that showcases my current work. The creation of this portfolio is part of of the work that I am currently showcasing. 
I have met all the requirements for this project including:
1) A header that has my name and links to sections on the page, as well as effects for those links when hovered over and clicked
2) A main description container with a recent photo of myself
3) The scroll feature that will you take you to the corresponding section when you click a link in the header
4) Images that enlarge when they are hovered over
5) Images that take you to a new designated webpage which opens in a new tab when clicked
6) A page and nav bar that adapts to fit the viewport
7) Styling and effects to enhance the look of the page
8) Links to every project repo that open in a new window
9) Brief descriptions of each project
10) A downloadable PDF of my resume, as well as links to LinkedIn, Github, and an option to email me
11) The use of Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS
12) Screenshots of my projects
